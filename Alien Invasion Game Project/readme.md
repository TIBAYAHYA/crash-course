the 3AM motivation hit, though not for long, I decided to finnaly start the projects part of the book python crash course, and with the game Alien Invasion being the first project, taking up to 3 chapters off the book, I envision this taking quite some time to finish.
here is a brief description of what the core concept of the game is  supposed to be:


            In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
            at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
            right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
            spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
            and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
            destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
            appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
            the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
            loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
