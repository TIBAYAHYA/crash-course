the 3AM motivation hit, though not for long, I decided to finnaly start the projects part of the book python crash course, and with the game Alien Invasion being the first project, taking up to 3 chapters off the book, I envision this taking quite some time to finish.
here is a brief description of what the core concept of the game is  supposed to be:


            In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
            at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
            right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
            spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
            and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
            destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
            appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
            the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
            loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.


few months into the book, the author seems to make alot of efficiency mistakes on his instructions, as well as making the code more complicated than It should, Im already regreting starting with this one instead of fluent python, but lets hope the same mistakes wont occur on the data and web chapters, which are the ones I starter this book in the first place

FINAL UPDATE:
dumped the whole pygame thing, because holy shit this thing is so boring and exhausting, the author instructions being bastardly inefficient,uncalled for, weirdly confusing, I honestly would have been better just building this whole thing faster bymyself with some copilot assistance.
thats It for the alien invasion game!
